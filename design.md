# Eden Old Age Home Management System - UI Design Guidelines

## Login Page

Design a minimalistic login page UI for the Eden Old Age Home Management System. The design should feature a central, rounded-corner card on a soft, light gray background. The card should have a subtle drop shadow to give it depth. At the top of the card, place a simple, black outline icon of a home with a heart symbol to represent care and community. Below the icon, in a clean, sans-serif font, add the heading "Welcome Back" with the sub-heading "Login to manage your community." Include two input fields with placeholders for "Username" and "Password," and a small eye icon on the right side of the password field to toggle visibility. The main call-to-action is a prominent, muted blue button with a white text label "LOG IN." Below the button, include two subtle text links: "Forgot Password?" and "Need an account? Sign Up" using a neutral text color. The overall layout should be clean, spacious, and centered, with ample whitespace.

**Branding Elements:**
- Application name: "Eden Old Age Home"
- Tagline: "Caring for our community"
- Color scheme: Soft blues, grays, and whites for a calming, professional appearance


## Dashboard

Design a minimalistic dashboard UI for the Eden Old Age Home Management System. The layout should have a fixed sidebar on the left and a main content area on the right.

**Sidebar:** The sidebar should be a clean white or light gray with a subtle divider from the main content. At the top, include the Eden logo with house and heart icon, followed by "eden" in bold and "OLD-AGE-HOME" in smaller text. Below it, create a vertical navigation menu with clean, black-outline icons and text labels for "Dashboard," "Residents," "Staff," "Activities," "Reports," and "Settings." The active link should be visually highlighted with a light blue background or color change. At the very bottom of the sidebar, place a small user profile section with a circular avatar and the user's name.

**Main Content Area:** The main content area should have a light gray background. At the top, include a personalized greeting like "Good Morning, [User Name]" with subtitle "Here's your community overview." The rest of the space should be filled with clean, card-based widgets. These cards should have rounded corners and subtle drop shadows. Include at least five cards:
1.  **Residents Card:** Title "Residents," a large number for the total count, subtitle "Total Residents," and a small icon of people.
2.  **Upcoming Activities Card:** Title "Upcoming Activities," a number for the count, and the next scheduled activity (e.g., "Movie Night 7 PM").
3.  **Critical Alerts Card:** Title "Critical Alerts" with a number and a list of urgent items (medication reminders, fall risks, etc.).
4.  **Occupancy Trend Card:** Title "Occupancy Trend (Last 6 Months)" with a simple, line-style graph showing resident capacity over time.
5.  **Recent Updates Card:** Title "Recent Updates" with a bulleted list of recent changes or notifications (new residents, system updates, etc.).
    The layout should be responsive, with the cards arranging themselves cleanly in a grid format.

## Residents Management Page

Design a minimalistic feature management UI, specifically for a resident list in the Eden Old Age Home Management System. The design should follow the same sidebar and main content layout as the dashboard.

**Main Content Area:**
1.  **Header:** Include the page title "Residents" with a brief sub-heading "Manage resident profiles and information." On the right, add a primary "Add New Resident" button with a plus icon.
2.  **Control Bar:** Below the header, include a clean search bar with a "Filter" label and a "Sort by" dropdown (e.g., "Sort by: Last Name").
3.  **Data Table:** The core of the UI is a clean, card-style data table with clear headers for columns: "Name," "Status," "Care Level," and "Last Active."
4.  **Table Rows:** Each row should represent a resident and include their details: a small circular avatar, their name, and room number (e.g., "Room 101"). The "Status" should be a color-coded tag (e.g., green for "Stable," red for "Needs Attention"). The "Care Level" should show appropriate care categories (e.g., "Assisted Living," "Memory Care"). On the far right of each row, add a small "Edit" button. The table should have a clean, light background with subtle lines separating the rows for readability. The entire design should feel lightweight and easy to scan.

## Additional Pages

**Staff Management Page:** Similar layout to residents page but for managing ward employees, doctors, and other staff members.

**Activities Page:** Manage scheduled activities, events, and recreational programs for residents.

**Reports Page:** Generate and view various reports including occupancy reports, medication reports, and financial summaries.

**Settings Page:** System configuration, user management, and application settings.
